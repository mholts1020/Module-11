# Module-11

In this project we use further our machine learning skills by using Facebook's Prophet to forecast and analyze MercadoLibre's ($MELI) search traffic, stock prices and sales figures.

Technologies
The following technologies were used to build and deploy this application:

Python - Version 3.9.7
Anaconda (Which includes Jupyter Lab and Pandas)
Path (from pathlib)
Facebook Prophet
PyStan
NumPy
DateTime
hvPlot
HoloViews
Installation and Usage Guide
Using Google Colab
In this project, we used Google Colab instead of using our traditional IDEs or Jupyter Lab, Google Colab is very similar to a Jupyter Notebook but does not require us to install libraries and dependencies on our local machine but rather install and import them directly onto the platform. The platform comes with many preinstalled libraries so it is only necessary to install some as you can see on the code.
